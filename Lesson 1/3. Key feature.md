### Key Features of EJS

1. 📝 **Embedded JavaScript Syntax**
   - **Tags**:
     - `<%= %>`: Outputs *HTML-escaped* content.
     - `<%- %>`: Outputs *unescaped* content (use with caution).
     - `<% %>`: Executes JavaScript without output (for loops, conditions).
     - `<%# %>`: *Comment* tag (not rendered in output).

2. 🔗 **Data Binding**
   - Injects dynamic data from the server into templates, allowing real-time updates to HTML.

3. 🔄 **Control Structures**
   - Supports JavaScript control structures (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`) for conditional rendering and loops within templates.

4. ♻️ **Reusable Templates and Partials**
   - Split templates into *partials* (like headers, footers) that can be included across pages for consistency and reduced code duplication.

5. ⚙️ **Express.js Compatibility**
   - Integrates seamlessly with Express.js as a view engine, making it a popular choice for rendering dynamic content in Node.js apps.

6. 🔒 **Automatic HTML Escaping**
   - EJS escapes HTML content by default with `<%= %>`, helping prevent XSS attacks.

7. 🛠️ **Error Handling**
   - Provides clear error messages to make debugging easier.
